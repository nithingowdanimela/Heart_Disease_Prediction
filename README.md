Title: Predictive Modeling of Heart Disease with Logistic Regression

Description:
The "Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression" project aims to develop a robust and reliable predictive model to assess an individual's risk of developing heart disease. Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and early detection and risk assessment are crucial for effective prevention and intervention strategies.

Project Overview:
Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to leverage logistic regression, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to create a predictive model that can classify individuals into two categories: those at high risk and those at low risk of developing heart disease. This model will assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and advising patients on necessary lifestyle changes or medical interventions.

Dataset:
The dataset i have been used in the project has been uploaded along with code named Heart Disease.csv check it once
The dataset containing various patient attributes, including demographic information, medical history, lifestyle factors (such as smoking and exercise habits), and clinical test results (e.g., cholesterol levels, blood pressure). This data is essential for training and evaluating the logistic regression model.

Model Development:
Logistic regression, a widely-used classification algorithm, is employed to build the predictive model. It models the relationship between the independent variables (patient attributes) and the binary outcome variable (presence or absence of heart disease). The model will be trained on a portion of the dataset and validated using appropriate techniques to optimize its performance.

Model Evaluation:
The project will assess the model's accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to measure its predictive capabilities. Cross-validation techniques will also be employed to ensure the model's generalizability and to minimize overfitting.

Conclusion:
The "Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression" project will contribute to improved heart disease risk assessment and early intervention, potentially saving lives and reducing the burden of cardiovascular diseases on healthcare systems and individuals. By leveraging logistic regression, the project aims to create a valuable tool for both healthcare providers and the general population in the ongoing battle against heart disease.
