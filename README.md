Title: Predictive Modeling of Heart Disease with Logistic Regression

Description:
The "Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression" project aims to develop a robust and reliable predictive model to assess an individual's risk of developing heart disease. Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and early detection and risk assessment are crucial for effective prevention and intervention strategies.

Project Overview:
Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to leverage logistic regression, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to create a predictive model that can classify individuals into two categories: those at high risk and those at low risk of developing heart disease. This model will assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and advising patients on necessary lifestyle changes or medical interventions.
